# Delegation Expense Tracker ‚Äì Knowledgebase

**Version:** 0.3 (October 2025)
**Author:** Pawe≈Ç Marciniak
**Purpose:** Central reference for app logic, tax rules, and business logic used in the Business Travel Tracker application.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concept

The app helps freelancers or small business owners document **business travel (delegations)** for accounting, taxation, and reimbursement purposes.

It keeps all **expenses, daily allowances (diety), currencies, and exchange rates** in one place, and calculates totals in PLN for tax or KPiR reporting.

The app is designed to be:

* ‚úÖ *Mobile-friendly, clean, minimal UI*
* ‚úÖ *Offline/local-data-ready (JSON mock first, backend later)*
* ‚úÖ *Expandable (PDF export, AI categorization, VAT summary)*

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Rules

### 3.1 Currency Conversion

All totals are shown in PLN using currency-specific exchange rates:

```
PLN_value = amount * currency_exchange_rate
```

**Supported Currencies (25+):**

**Major European:**
- EUR (4.35), GBP (5.3), CHF (4.7), NOK (0.38), SEK (0.38), DKK (0.58)

**Central/Eastern European:**
- PLN (1.0), HUF (0.012), CZK (0.18), RON (0.88), BGN (2.22), HRK (0.58), RSD (0.037)

**Major Global:**
- USD (4.2), CAD (3.1), AUD (2.8), JPY (0.028), CNY (0.58), INR (0.05), BRL (0.82), MXN (0.25)

**Middle East & Africa:**
- AED (1.14), SAR (1.12), ZAR (0.22), EGP (0.14)

The exchange rates can be:

* Taken manually from NBP average rate on the day before expense (`t-1`)
* Currently using realistic mock rates for testing
* Future: Live NBP API integration for real-time rates

### 3.2 Daily Allowance (Diety)

Each trip generates a daily allowance according to Polish tax law:

| Country        | Daily Allowance (EUR) |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Hungary        | 43                    |
| Germany        | 49                    |
| Italy          | 48                    |
| France         | 50                    |
| Czech Republic | 41                    |

Formula:

```
total_diety = number_of_days * allowance_rate
```

Partial days:

* <8h ‚Üí 1/3 rate
* 8‚Äì12h ‚Üí 1/2 rate
* > 12h ‚Üí full day

Meals provided reduce diety:

* Breakfast ‚Üí -15%
* Lunch ‚Üí -30%
* Dinner ‚Üí -30%

### 3.3 Expense Categories and Deductibility

| Taxi / Public Transport       | ‚úÖ           | Must show route related to business             |
| Misc (e.g. printing, tickets) | ‚úÖ           | If directly related to meeting/event            |

### 3.4 Documentation Rules

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Polish Delegation Law Reference

### 4.1 Scope

This app follows **RozporzƒÖdzenie Ministra Pracy i Polityki Spo≈Çecznej z 29.01.2013 r.** regarding domestic and foreign delegations.

### 4.2 Key Rules

#### ‚úÖ Per diems (diety)

* Used only for **meals and small personal expenses**.
* Limited by official daily rates per country.
* Reduced if meals are provided.

#### ‚ùå Hotels, flights, transport

* **No fixed maximum limits**.
* Fully deductible if:

  * The expense is justified by business purpose.
  * You hold valid documentation (invoice, booking).
* ‚ÄúReasonable and necessary‚Äù rule applies (no luxury misuse).

#### üí° Accounting rules

| Expense type    | Tax deductible?  | Limit/cap                   | Documentation required |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Per diem        | Yes              | Country rate                | Delegation note        |
| Hotel           | Yes              | None                        | Invoice with NIP       |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Calculations Overview

```
total_expenses_PLN = Œ£(expense.amount * exchange_rate)
trip_total_PLN = total_expenses_PLN + total_diety_PLN
```

If under ‚Äúulga na start‚Äù:

```
income_tax_base = income - trip_total_PLN
```

If `income_tax_base <= 0`, no income tax is due.
